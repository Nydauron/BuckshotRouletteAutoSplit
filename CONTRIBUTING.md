# Contributing

Thanks for expressing interest in contributing! Before you begin making your
changes, let's go over some tips and guidelines.

## Submitting bug reports and feature requests

When reporting bugs, please include your version of Buckshot Roulette and a
minimal reproducible example (e.g. autosplit profile and any other custom
changes), providing as many details needed such that others and I can reproduce
the behavior you are experiencing. Please also include the expected result vs
the actual result if applicable.

When suggesting a new feature, please explain your reasoning as to why the
feature should be added, what potential problems it solves, any alternatives,
and any disadvantanges.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repo and make your changes
  - If this is confusing, I'd suggest reading up on [Git and
  GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git).
2. Create a [new Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/Nydauron/BuckshotRouletteAutoSplit/pulls)
  - Please describe in detail what your PR changes including but not limited to
  any feature addtions, bug fixes, and optimizations.
  - Your PR should add and modify documentation and the README such that it
  remains consistent with any feature changes or bug fixes made in the PR.
