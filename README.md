Buckshot Roulette Autosplit Profiles
====================================

A repo containing video autosplit profiles to be used with
[AutoSplit](https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit) and [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/).

## Setup

0. Clone this repo or [download it as a zip](https://github.com/Nydauron/BuckshotRouletteAutoSplit/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
1. Install [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/)
2. Install Toufool's [Autosplit](https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit?tab=readme-ov-file#download-and-open)

## Configuring LiveSplit

There are provided layout files within each folder in the repo for your
convienence. The provided split images and split segments reflect each other
and will work if both are used together. You may need to modify the split
images or the layout to fix correctness if you choose to add any customizations.

Configuration closely follows [the instructions for LiveSplit integration on Toufool's
AutoSplit](https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit?tab=readme-ov-file#livesplit-integration-tutorial),
however please note to use the `settings.toml` files and `split_images/`
folders in this repo for configuring "profile path" in LiveSplit and "split image
folder" in AutoSplit.
